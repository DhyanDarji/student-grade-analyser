# student-grade-analyser
Student Grade Analyser: Created to analyse student grades quickly!

The tool performs the following actions:
- Inputs student name and their grade from the user or from an .xlsx file.
- Calculates Average Grade
- Calculates Standard Deviation of Grade
- Plots a Histogram showing distribution of grades
- Plots a Normal distribution (we make the assumption that the data will form a Normal distribution)
- Plots a Cumulative distribution
- Outputs summary of all student grades or individual student grades along with how they did compared to the average student.

This repository also has a lot of files which showcase how the project was developed and tested!
